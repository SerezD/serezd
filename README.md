Hi there!
<br> <br/>
I'm Dario Serez, Ph.D. student at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) as part of the Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision (PAVIS) research line.
<br> <br/>
In 2021 I obtained my Master Degree in Computer Science and engineering at the University of Verona (Italy). My thesis was focused on the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DALL·E</a> system by OpenAI, which I studied and replicated from scratch. 
<br> <br/>
I'm actually working on generative models and image generation, using both Transformers and Diffusion Models. 
<br> <br/>
